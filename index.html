    <p class="justified-text">
        Since June 2021, I have been a Junior Gameplay Programmer at Ubisoft Milan, where I am part of the Artificial Intelligence development team working on Mario&#43;Rabbids: Sparks of Hope. Before then, I was a Junior Gameplay Programmer at Milestone S.R.L from March to April 2020, where I worked with Unreal Engine 4. In December 2020, I was awarded a Bachelor&#39;s Degree in Computer Science with full marks from Sapienza, University of Rome. Since September 2021, I have been attending a part-time MSc remotely in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Leeds. I have always been passionate about the Entertainment industry with a careful eye for Videogames. Crafting innovative, educative, and beloved products is one of the things that gratifies my soul the most. I believe in team-working, coordination and expertise as fundamental ingredients to succeed.
    </p>
    <h5 class="head-name"><strong>Expertise</strong></h4>
    <p class="justified-text">
        I am proficient in using C/C&#43;&#43;, GLSL, Python, ASM MIPS, Web technologies - HTML, CSS, JS, PHP -, Haskell, MySQL, SparkQL and Bash. The main engine/libraries/tools I am confident with are CodeIgniter, Bootstrap, Vue.JS, Unreal Engine 4, OpenGL, boost, Pandas, SKlearn, Numpy, Jira, Perforce, Swarm Reviews and Git. I have a strong knowledge of Linear Algebra, Probability theory, and Calculus applied to Computer Science.

I designed and engineered the entire corporate website, and Content Management System used to maintain the website up-to-date. On some occasions, I created custom software solutions to automatize some internal aspects of the video production with ad-hoc Python software and more. I still work with them occasionally, but only if strictly needed due to the limited time available.</h6>

I also developed a more in-depth knowledge of maths, especially Linear Algebra, Probability theory and calculus. It helps me in my everyday software engineer life and gives me more flexibility when learning from academic or research articles.</h6>
